Small town boy from Tamil Nadu starts vernacular platform GUVI for IT learning
Arun Prakash was the first graduate in his family. The 33 year old completed his BTech from Sethu Institute of Technology, Virudhunagar, Tamil Nadu. As his family could not afford it, he did not own a computer and brushed up his technical skills by writing programmes on paper and running them on computers at an internet café. Things changed for the better, however, when he impressed the recruiters at Honeywell with his technical skills.
His professional journey for the next 13 years went off well with stints at Honeywell-Aerospace, KLA-Tencor and Kalido. Then in 2011, Arun, his wife Sridevi (32) and his friend S.P. Balamurugan (32) conceptualised the idea of GUVI. At that time, they were all working together at PayPal and decided to quit to dedicate more time to GUVI. Chennai based GUVI provides a platform to connect budding technologists with industry experts and bridges the skill gap needed in IT companies, by sharing their technical learning as courses in vernacular languages and through a personalised mentorship programme. 
On the startup's beginnings, Arun says,GUVI started as a volunteering activity when we were working at PayPal in 2011. We started off with videos explaining technical jargon in native languages like Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Bengali and Kannada. We got amazing feedback from learners not only from India but across the globe like UK, Canada, Germany, France, US, Singapore.” The trio started GUVI with a seed capital of Rs 10 lakh until GUVI was incubated by IITM’s RTBI, an online mentoring or learning platform, focussed on IT-based technical learning in vernacular languages. The startup was then rewarded with a seed fund of Rs. five lakh. GUVI was officially launched in November 2014 and its YouTube channel has gained more than one million views and has more than 5,000 subscribers. Balamurugan holds MCA and MBA from Anna University. Before starting GUVI, he was a technologist at PayPal. Sridevi did her BE in CS from SASTRA University and her career at Honeywell-Aerospace was followed by stints at TCS and PayPal. Customer-acquisition phase GUVI acquired its first paid customer through YouTube. He was from UK and wanted mentorship to learn design patterns in Java. Each course by GUVI is a blend of video lectures that focus on context-based learning, short notes, coding playground, assignment and assessment. The video lectures are in vernacular languages, while the text contents are in English. The platform allows users the option to choose the language of his/her choice.
The learners use the inbuilt coding playground to practice and upload the assignments. The analytics system tracks the user activity and unlocks new content as they progress in each level. The game engine brings the gamification elements into the system and rewards the user with points and badges as the learner achieves the goal. The platform is hosted in AWS and is built on our very own custom-built web stack,” explains Balamurugan.
Currently, the technical videos are available in five languages- Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada and Hindi. Paid courses are available in Tamil, which will be extended to other four languages by 2016. GUVI hosts more than 500 technical videos in vernacular languages. The startup offers courses from data structures, C, C++, Java, Python, ROR to advanced ones on big data, machine learning, R programming, IOS and Android. The charges for online video courses range between Rs 500 and Rs 3,000 and for mentorship, between Rs 15,000 and Rs 35,000. GUVI has partnered with more than 50 colleges in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Currently, 72 people from India, UK, USA and Germany have been mentored. Sridevi says, “All the videos are home grown and created by friends who are experts in the IT industry. However, we have started procuring content from third parties also. The content undergoes many rounds of review by our content curating team.” In the past eight months, GUVI attracted a user base of 14,000, among which 3,600 were paid customers. Majority of the users are from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisa and Bhopal. Going forward In 2016, GUVI wishes to add 36 IT courses and 1,000 videos in the five languages. Arun says they are aiming to target 10 per cent of online learning market in India. The iOS and Android app for GUVI will be available soon for on-the-go learning. By 2017, 2,500 videos will be added in eight Indian languages, with five per cent of the content in Arabic and Spanish, according to company projections. And by 2018, GUVI intends to increase the number of videos by 5,000 with 10 per cent of online learning market in Arabic and Spanish and two per cent of the contents in German.
The revenue generation started from July 2015 and till December, we have achieved an overall revenue of Rs 11 lakh. We expect to achieve Rs 35 lakh by the end of this fiscal year.” Yourstory's take  According to a IAMAI and KPMG report, English language content accounts for 56 per cent of the content on the Internet, while Indian languages account for less than 0.1 per cent. But, a vast majority of India’s population prefers consuming content in their native language. Availability of local language content can open up multiple avenues and opportunities for startups to leverage. Applications like InShorts, Way2News, Gupshup, Hike, Dailyhunt, Reverie’s Language-as-a-Service are focussing more on the local languages to cater to the ‘next billion’ Indian Internet users. The number of local language Internet users in India is growing at 47 per cent year-on-year and has touched 127 million in June 2015, revealed the IAMAI and IMRB International report.

Three Techies in Chennai Have Made It Possible for Students to Learn Programming in Indian Languages
A website started by three Chennai-based professionals is helping students across India overcome the English language barrier to learn programming, and to launch their careers in the field of information technology.
GUVI provides video tutorials, college courses, assignments, and practice papers to students who aspire to build careers in the field of information technology, and does so in English and vernacular languages, currently Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada.
Founded by Chennai-based software professionals Arun Prakash, S P Balamurugan and M Sridevi, GUVI was born four years ago. “We went to our college in Madurai for an alumni meet, and because we were there after a long time, the expectation was that everything — right from the infrastructure to teaching methodology and other aspects of the learning environment – would have improved. But we were disappointed to see that things were actually worse. While the infrastructure had improved, the amount of exposure students received to the outside world remained the same.
One thing that stood out was the fact that there were many talented students, but they were held back by the language barrier. Their sparse knowledge of English made it difficult for them to follow lessons, particularly those related to computers,” said Arun.
The trio returned to Chennai and began thinking of ways to help these students. Soon, GUVI was born, initially just as a YouTube channel. “We started a YouTube channel and started uploading instructional videos in vernacular languages. For instance, if you wanted to learn coding or programming in your native tongue, you could do that,” said Arun. The channel soon had over 4,000 subscribers and more than a million views. Many students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities wrote in, letting them know that the videos had a positive impact on their lives. This motivated the founders and they decided to quit their jobs to launch an official GUVI platform that would make available mentors, practice material, and job opportunities.
Arun had 14 years of experience in the IT industry, and had worked with Symantec earlier; Balamurugan and Sridevi had worked with PayPal. Leaving behind this cushioned corporate life, the three of them registered GUVI in November 2014. Soon enough, the start-up received a chance to work with the QEEE project, which aims to teach the Python programming in 150 colleges in India in local languages.
In order to utilise GUVI, students must create their accounts on the website, and in turn, they gain access to most of the videos free of cost. Students who opt to sign up for special packages, advanced courses, practice assignments, etc., have to pay fees ranging from Rs. 800 to Rs. 3,000. All the videos are made by industry professionals who work in the particular technology field. “If it is a video about Android programming, a developer who has some six years of experience in the field makes it, or provides a voiceover for it. The content is made only by experts who have hands-on knowledge,” said Arun. GUVI has courses on programming (from the beginner to expert levels), databases, web development, and mobile development.
Students with little knowledge of English or with no background in programming can simply use personal computers to log on to the portal and learn using the available instructional videos. They can also use the various learning exercises to hone their skills. Their performance in these exercises is reflected in a ‘profile’, which is used as a resume by prospective employers to assess their skills. The platform also gives reward points to users who practise and finish their courses, which is again visible on their performance profiles.
Arun estimates that at least 30,000 students have benefitted from the portal and are now proficient in computer programming. They use PCs to practice what they learn and are equipped with the right set of skills for different jobs. “The pay package these students attract is anywhere between Rs. 2.5 lakh to Rs. 12 lakh annually, depending on their skills and the field. Given that many of these students are first-time graduates from their families, it’s a huge step forward for them.”
GUVI has a core team of nine people and an extended team of experts to help with content creation. The team also works with colleges in Chennai and Coimbatore so the latter can purchase their content and let their students use it for practice. This helps spread the word about the website too.
Arun is proud of the fact that the widespread reach of GUVI has helped many talented girls gain access to a platform where they can learn, practise, and challenge assumptions about their expertise. “Once, a hi-tech startup company was hiring from GUVI. Many people assume boys are better at programming than girls. But we shattered this stereotype during the hiring process when the first person selected for the job was a girl. This is a platform where girls too come and showcase their skills and this is mainly because they find role models here. One of these is a girl who we mentored and who now works as a developer. She says if it were not for GUVI, she would have been married and without a job by now,” said Arun proudly.
GUVI has made knowledge that is useful to many students seeking careers in the IT industry, accessible, regardless of their linguistic backgrounds. With hard work and dedication, there is no reason that they cannot go forward, rise in their careers and fulfil their untapped potential.
